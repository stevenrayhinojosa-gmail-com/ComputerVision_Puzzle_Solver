# JPEG Puzzle Solver
This Python script, employing the powerful Pillow library for image processing, is designed to solve (reconstruct) a puzzle using a set of JPEG pieces. The puzzle pieces are uniquely identified by the number of red and blue dots, representing the column and row indices of the puzzle, respectively.

Problem Description:
In this problem, each puzzle piece is characterized by the count of red and blue dots. The number of red dots signifies the column index, while the number of blue dots signifies the row index of the puzzle. For instance, a piece with 1 RED and 2 BLUE dots indicates that the piece is located at column 1 and row 2 of the puzzle.

Key Features:
Opening and Saving Puzzle Images:

Utilizes the Image.open() method to open a full image containing puzzle pieces in JPEG format.
Employs img.save(file) to save the opened image, preserving modifications for future reference or analysis.
Displaying and Inspecting Image Properties:

Uses img.show() to display the puzzle image using the default system image viewer.
Retrieves and inspects properties such as image type, size, filename, and format description.
Image Cropping and Pasting:

Utilizes the img.crop((x, y, w, h)) method to crop the image based on specified coordinates.
Attempts to paste another image (presumably stored in a variable dots) onto the original image at the specified location.
Example Use Case:
Reconstruct a puzzle by arranging JPEG pieces based on the count of red and blue dots.
Explore different arrangements to visualize the complete image.
Usage:
Ensure that the Pillow library is installed (pip install Pillow).
Adjust file paths and filenames according to your directory structure and puzzle image files.
Run the script to open, inspect, and manipulate the puzzle pieces.
Feel free to customize the script to suit your specific puzzle-solving needs or integrate additional features for a more interactive experience.
