# Computer Vision Puzzle Solver
This Python script harnesses the capabilities of computer vision, specifically leveraging the Pillow library, to solve (reconstruct) a puzzle from a set of JPEG pieces. Each puzzle piece is uniquely identified by the count of red and blue dots, representing the column and row indices of the puzzle.

Problem Overview:
In this application of computer vision, puzzle pieces are characterized by the number of red and blue dots. The red dots denote the column index, and the blue dots denote the row index of the puzzle. For instance, a piece with 1 RED and 2 BLUE dots signifies its location at column 1 and row 2 of the puzzle.

Key Features:
Image Processing with Computer Vision:

Utilizes computer vision techniques through the Pillow library to analyze and process the puzzle pieces.
Leverages image cropping, pasting, and inspection to facilitate the reconstruction of the puzzle.
Dynamic Puzzle Reassembly:

Employs image cropping (img.crop((x, y, w, h))) to extract specific puzzle regions based on provided coordinates.
Attempts to dynamically paste additional puzzle components onto the original image to reconstruct the puzzle.
Interactive Puzzle Exploration:

Integrates computer vision for inspecting image properties such as type, size, filename, and format description.
Provides an interactive environment for exploring different arrangements to visualize the complete puzzle image.
Example Use Case:
Employ computer vision to automate the reconstruction of a puzzle based on the distinctive dot patterns in each puzzle piece.
Experiment with different approaches to dynamically assemble the puzzle using computer vision techniques.
Usage:
Ensure the Pillow library is installed (pip install Pillow).
Adjust file paths and filenames according to your directory structure and puzzle image files.
Run the script to engage computer vision in the puzzle-solving process.
Feel free to tailor the script to meet specific computer vision requirements or expand its capabilities for a more advanced puzzle-solving experience.
