#In this problem, you are given a set of JPEG puzzle pieces and you are required to write a
program to solve (reconstruct)the puzzle. The coordinate of each piece is indicated by the
number of red and blue dots in the piece. The number of red dots denotes the column index,
while the number of blue dots denotes the row index of the puzzle. For example, a piece
with 1 RED and 2 BLUE dots indicate that the piece is located at column 1 and row 2 of the
puzzle (full image), as shown in Fig.1.#
